	<h2>Humorous Writing</h2>
	<p><i>This piece was an assignment for my Creative Writing class. Picture your average fantasy world, then throw in some absurdities. Surprisingly, I
		wrote this </i>before<i> I'd read Terry Pratchett.</i></p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		Absalom was proud of his new job. It was a tedious one, and not a position the majority would enjoy, but he felt at home in it. Even better, he’d been
		immediately assigned a task. Despite the fact that the end of the world was nearing and labor was in high demand, Absalom would only accept a position fit
		for his level of expertise.
	</p>
	<p>
		With a sigh, Absalom sat back in his ornate wooden chair and opened the first book in the stack in front of him. In this journal, he kept accounts of the
		happenings in the diplomatic meetings he attended. This included the names of the ambassadors he spoke with as well as the opinions and requests they had
		made. <em>The world of a plenipotentiary must always be organized,</em> he reflected. <em>No room for error at all.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Absalom winced as he heard his companion’s voice from outside his cabin. Quorde was the opposite of what he needed from an assistant, but at the same time
		he understood the Council’s decision to pair the two together. With all the tension caused by the beginning of the apocalypse, it was beneficial to be on
		good terms with a near-superhero.
	</p>

	<p>
		Quorde stepped down from the wooden deck of the skyboat. Looking around at the lush greenery of his homeland, he let out a sigh. He could spend hours
		sitting on a hill in his beautiful kingdom of Morgeo doing any variety of activities. Introspective meditation, sketching, napping, or filling out tax
		forms, it all felt the same in the right environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oh wait, he was supposed to be on a diplomatic mission.
	</p>
	<p>
		Knocked out of his reverie, Quorde froze and turned sharply, setting his course for the skyboat once more. Except, there was a slight problem. His left foot
		was planted firmly on a rock, but his right was in the air, making him tip forward rather quickly. His feet sometimes did try to fly, and he couldn’t help
		it. Quorde was so majestic that even the ground bowed down before him. He tried to forgive the earth rather than get annoyed, though, as he knew the natural
		forces could not come close to understanding his magnificent existence.
	</p>
	<p>
		Quorde stumbled—no, <em>gracefully dismounted</em> his rock—and continued the act of walking. He briefly turned and gave a rude gesture to the ground
		behind him, a polite but firm reminder of his superiority. Besides, he had a wonderfully large collection of these rude gestures and couldn’t pass up the
		opportunity to try out the rarer ones.
	</p>
	<p>
		Boarding the skyboat once more, Quorde had an impressive insight. He couldn’t wait to retrieve his Ambuozi ambassador guy and share his newfound revelation.
		He peeked his head inside the front cabin, interrupting Absalom’s peaceful work.
	</p>
	<p>“Where’s that guy I’m supposed to talk to?”</p>
	<p>“<em>That guy</em> you’re referring to happens to be the son of Ambo’s most important scholar, Quorde.”</p>
	<p>“So, sure, he’s important. Yeah. But where is he?”</p>
	<p>Absalom set his book down and stared blankly at Quorde. “Where did you see him last?”</p>
	<p>“Well, that was&#x2014;” He hesitated. “He was in his room.”</p>
	<p>Absalom nodded. “Then I’d recommend you check his room.”</p>
	<p>“Sure,” Quorde called as he shut the door behind himself.</p>

		Agzu was mildly infuriated. He was supposed to be treated like an honored guest, yet he was greeted by a Morgean! Moreover, this specific Morgean didn’t
		even act respectfully to his own mentor, let alone the son of Manj Hazot, the renowned scholar, politician, author, and pigeon trainer. Well, at least that
		other guy—Agzu couldn’t quite remember his name—seemed competent. While his father had periodically scolded him for “judging a house by its facade,” he
		could detect an obvious correlation between respectable-sounding names and respectable individuals.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not one to make calm entrances, the absurd Morgean burst into the room. Agzu flinched as Quorde ran up to his desk, grinning as if eager to share a deep
		secret. Bothersome.
	</p>
	<p>“What is it?” Agzu asked bitterly.</p>
	<p>“I know how you Ambuozi make cheese so shiny!”</p>
