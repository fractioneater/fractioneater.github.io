	<h2>Third Time's the Charm</h2>
	<p><i>This piece was a </i>longer
		work<i> for my Creative Writing class. This means it was entirely my choice what I wrote. And what's more interesting than a satire on communism?</i></p>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<p><i>It didn’t work out in the Soviet Union. It didn’t work out in China. So, what’s stopping it from working out in our very own United States of
		America?
	</i></p>
	<p><i>
		This thrilling essay covers the benefits—but not so much the costs—of communism and explains precisely why we need such a modern and enlightened way of
		organizing society.

		How often do you think about the wealth gap in our society? Poverty? What about those ostentatious neighbors who can’t help but display their wealth in the
		form of massive parties, extravagant decorations, and fireworks on Independence Day? It sure would be nice if we could put aside our differences and chip
		in to keep the government running smoothly. All I ask is that you think about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many problems we deal with every day that could be eliminated so easily. For example, we generally regard covetousness as a bad thing, yet we find
		it challenging to avoid. We, as humans, are naturally envious. We are violets looking up to sunflowers, focusing on the height we don’t have instead of the
		beauty we do. Many philosophical solutions to this problem have been proposed, but we clearly have not adopted them. There is, however, an alternative. The
		simplest solution is the best one, and in this case, the simple solution is quite obvious: eliminate belongings. Pardon me as I give you this insight into
		my claim.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Ahem.</em> The setting: a small village in the countryside. It doesn’t matter where; the whole world operates under a unified system. A ring of
		houses—all neat, all designed according to The Standard—surrounds the tall, brightly lit village center. Rations are hunted and harvested from the communal
		farms and forests nearby, and stored in the village center for distribution.
	</p>
	<p>
		Inside one house on the circle, a family sits in front of the fireplace. Two kids, each in the lap of a parent, share their stories from school. Because the
		girl got to speak first yesterday, her brother does so today. Their stories aren’t very different anyway; these parents were lucky enough to have twins,
		meaning their children are taught using the same curriculum (as outlined in The Standard). In the next house over, another pair of children talk with their
		parents in front of their own fireplace. To keep the population stable, as well as prevent disparity between households, each family is made up of two
		children and two adults. Factors of two are easy to deal with, so this has a bonus of extra simplicity.
	</p>
	<p>
		In such a tight-knit community, there’s no bullying or mocking on the school playground, and that’s only <em>partially</em> because the school doesn’t have
		a playground. Relationships are strong and permanent—equally so for everyone. Reader, picture yourself in this idyllic town. So many of your worries
		including taxes, client behavior, or the price of food, are no longer a burden. You never have to worry about losing your job, because The Rotation, as
		described in The Standard, makes sure all jobs are covered and people are cycled through them. Peaceful life is finally an option.
	</p>
	<p>Again, pardon my style of persuasion.</p>
	<p>
		The intricate history of communism, this perfect system of government which represents each of us equally, is something that cannot be overlooked. It began
		with Karl Marx, the brilliant nonconformist who recognized the potential of a state without classes or money. He is known for co-authoring <em>The Communist
		Manifesto,</em>but also published <em>Capital: A Critique of Political Economy,</em> in which he proved that capitalism would eventually collapse. A
		dedicated and genius philosopher, Marx took up calculus and even made a few contributions to mathematics for his writing. Despite their unsurpassed
		excellence, however, his theories were not widely accepted. ‘Twas not until thirty-four years after his death that the first attempt at his superior
		societal system was made.
	</p>
	<p>
		Attempt, meaning unsuccessful endeavor. Vladimir Lenin’s 1917 revolt did not bring the government anywhere near perfect communism. Neither did Joseph
		Stalin, his successor. You see, the word I just used is proof they didn’t succeed. In an ideal society, with everyone parallel in status, there wouldn’t
		<em>be</em> a successor. The thought of an imperfect dictatorship makes one shudder—almost as much the ridiculous positive feedback loop of our free market.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second attempt at a Marxist government (pardon the oxymoron) was in China. Mao Zedong and his Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, sixty-six
		years after Marx’s death. Once again, as you’d expect, it didn’t come to fruition. A peaceful, communal China never existed. Just like in the Soviet Union,
		people were too full of self-esteem to properly adopt communism. The fools! It’s almost as if the filthy, chaotic system of government in place prevented a
		utopia from taking form.
	</p>
	<p>
		There was a period of time in our good old USA known as the Red Scare. Between 1950 and 1954, people were freaking out about socialists, leftists, commies,
		whatever you want to call them. Here’s the thing: they didn’t have the correct definition of the word. We were scared of the “pretend communism” that the
		Soviets had adopted, and didn’t even consider the benefits real communism could bring. That’s why we, as a country, need to make a concerted effort to
		embrace the one true political system. Nobody deserves any worse.
