## **Battle Bound**
_IMPORTANT:_<br>
I did not create this game. All I did was bring it to the web.

This game was made by [@KIKOKO_](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/KIKOKO_) and originally published on Scratch where it was banned for violence. It was still up on Turbowarp, however, until changes to the Scratch API prevented unshared projects from being visible on Turbowarp.

This was created using the Turbowarp packager and is connected to Turbowarp's cloud server (yes, you can play online).
